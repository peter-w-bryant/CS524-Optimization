    "The bakery from Homework 2 is expanding operations to include more than just cakes, but they need your help! The bakery wants to make a variety of desserts, each classified according to one of four types: \\{Cake, Cookie, Pastry, Candy\\}. Each dessert belongs to exactly one of the four types. There is a set of 11 different features the bakery has identified by reading extensive reviews of desserts, and the bakery wants to ensure that they offer at least one dessert that has each of the features. To cut down on cost and prep, the bakery wants to make no more than three desserts of each possible type. \n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Write a __maximum flow problem__ that will tell the bakery whether or not there is a feasible set of desserts to make that will meet the bakery's requirements. _Hint:_  Draw the network first. _Hint2.0:_ There is some code below that will help you get started building the nodes and arcs in Julia. There is more than one way to build this network; you do not have to follow the structure I have given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Without doing any additional calculations, what is the smallest upper bound you can give on the maximum flow through this network (i.e., the minimum cut)? What set of arcs gives this minimum cut? Use your answer to (a) and duality theory to prove such a cut exists (_Hint:_ You can answer this directly with a single statement from the duality module).\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) (Ungraded) To get more familiar with random number generation and manipulating Julia code, try altering some of the input data (e.g., the seed or the density parameter). Note what happens. How low can you make the density before no solution can be found? What would change if you required __exactly__ 3 desserts from each group, rather than 3 being an upper bound?"

There are four time periods during the day that must be covered ($t = 1,2,3,4$), and 3 possible shifts, each of which corresponds to working 2 consecutive time periods. The cost per employee assigned to shift $i$ is $c_i$, for $i = 1,2,3$. Each time period has a required number of employees who must be working in order to cover demand for your delicious customizable burritos (required employees are $7, 8, 5, 9$, in that order). Suppose you have already built an optimizaiton model to deterimine how many employees to hire for each shift (model is shown below). The decision variables for this model are $x_i$ for $i = 1,2,3$, where $x_1$ represents the number of employees scheduled to work shift 1 (time periods 1 and 2), $x_2$ represents the number of employees scheduled to work shift 2 (time periods 2 and 3), and $x_3$ represents the number of employees hired to work shift 3 (time periods 3 and 4). \n",
