There is one particular style of engine that comes in three different sizes (call them \"size 1,\" \"size 2,\" and \"size 3\"). The contractor processes raw materials to produce the engines. Processing a pallet of raw materials costs \\\\$700 per pallet and produces 2 size 1 engines, 1 size 2 engine, and 1 size 3 engine. Size 1 engines sell for \\\\$160 each, size 2 engines sell for \\\\$210 each, and size 3 engines sell for \\\\$300 each. Engines (of any size) can be stored from month to month. Keeping engines in good working condition costs \\$5$$\\times$(engine size) per engine per month (i.e., \\\\$5 for size 1, \\\\$10 for size 2, \\\\$15 for size 3).\n",

The contractor currently has 10 size 1 engines and 2 size 3 engines (no size 2 engines) in stock, and wishes to have at least that much -- plus at least one size 2 engine -- in stock at the end of month 3. \n",
